Epilepsy is a neurological disorder condition of the brain and Encephalography (EEG) is one which is used commonly for its detection in the clinical 
approach. Identification of the brain signals manually is a tedious process and time-consuming, where it puts a heavy burden on the Neurosurgeons which 
may even affect their performance. In the Detection of Binary Epileptic scenarios, Several automatic techniques have been proposed to assist neurosurgeons 
to use the traditional approach. This project aims in detecting binary epileptic conditions like the seizure vs. non-seizure or normal vs. ictal. This system has 
been proposed based on the Deep Learning techniques, which is an ensemble of Pyramidal One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (P-1D-CNN) 
models. To overcome the limitations of a small amount of data, Data Augmentation of Schemes were done for the P-1D-CNN Model. Further the Accuracy 
score has been calculated and predicted. The prediction determines whether the condition of the patient is Epileptic or not.
